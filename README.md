## A repo for understanding JS concepts

This repo will be following [Frontend-RoadMap](https://roadmap.sh/frontend?r=frontend-beginner), the code is to clear my concepts about the info present in the roadmap. 
This repo is to avoid tutorial hell and aims to just be better at JS and then do some personal projects in JS. 

If you want to contribute to the project with some better tutorials please open up a PR.
